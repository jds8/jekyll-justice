## Background

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.jpg">

I am a graduate student in computer science at the University of British Columbia supervised by Frank Wood. My current research is in machine learning at [Inverted AI](https://www.inverted.ai/) and the [UBC PLAI group](https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/). Prior to this I was at the [Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/) and before that at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/).

## Research Interests

My interests include machine learning for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent coordination as well as probabilistic and functional programming.
