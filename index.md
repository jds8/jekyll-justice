## Quickstart Guide

In order to use and customize this website generator, the following links
should prove useful:

 - [README](README) How to install, deploy, etc.
 - [CHEATSHEET](cheatsheet) How to quickly generate content.

The easiest way to get started, _by far_, is to simply clone the repository,
ablate the parts you don't want, and edit the rest to your liking.  Ultimately
there is a large amount of customization that you could contemplate.  How
far you go is up to you!

## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.jpg">

I am an associate professor of computer science at the University of British Columbia.


## Research Interests

My primary research areas are probabilistic programming and applied statistical
machine learning. My research interests range from the development of new
probabilistic models and inference algorithms to real-world applications. My
research contributions include probabilistic programming systems, new models and
inference algorithms, and novel applications of such models to problems in
neuroscience, natural language processing, robotics, and compression.
